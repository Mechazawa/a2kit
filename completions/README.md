# Shell Completions

These are automatically generated shell scripts (generated by `clap_complete`) to provide tab-completions for `a2kit`.  As of this writing there is no facility provided for automatically installing the scripts.  The procedure is different for each shell, and can even depend on the particulars of how a given shell is configured.

As a simple example, if you are using `zsh` and have `oh-my-zsh`, you can simply drop `_a2kit` into `~/.oh-my-zsh/completions`.
