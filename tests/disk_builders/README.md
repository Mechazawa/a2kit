# Disk Builders for Testing

This folder contains BASIC programs that are used to write files to a disk from within an emulator.  These emulator-generated disks are then compared, sector by sector, with disks generated by `a2kit`.

## DOS 3.2

For DOS 3.2 there is a single interactive Integer BASIC disk builder that takes care of all cases.  The tests expect these disks to be `INIT`ed with the builder as the greeting program, always called `HELLO`.

## DOS 3.3 and ProDOS

For DOS 3.3 and ProDOS there is a common Applesoft BASIC program similar to the Integer BASIC program.

## ProDOS

Apart from the common builder, ProDOS also has its own builder to test directory operations.

## Pascal

No builders.  Pascal test disks only contain short Pascal programs.  These were generated by directly entering them into the Pascal editor, and saving them with the filer.  The listings are hard coded into the tests.

## CP/M

No builders.  CP/M test disks only contain short text files produced using `ED.COM`.
