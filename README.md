# Apple ][ Kit (a2kit)

This is a [rust](https://rust-lang.org)-based command line tool that manipulates Apple ][ language files and disk images.

Running `a2kit --help` reveals the subcommands and further help.

For detailed information see the [wiki](https://github.com/dfgordon/a2kit/wiki).

## Status

No release yet, but getting closer.  If you would like to try it you will have to clone both this project and `a2kit_macro`.  Then use [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) to build it.
