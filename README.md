# Apple ][ Kit (a2kit)

This is a [rust](https://rust-lang.org)-based command line tool that manipulates Apple ][ language files and disk images.

Running `a2kit --help` reveals the subcommands and further help.

For detailed information see the [wiki](https://github.com/dfgordon/a2kit/wiki).

## Status

Basic tests are passing, but there are some optimization issues, and a few capabilities to round out.  The CLI can be installed using `cargo install a2kit`, see [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html).  The library documentation is accessible from [crates](https://crates.io/crates).
