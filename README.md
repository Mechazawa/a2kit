# Apple ][ Kit (a2kit)

Command line interface and library for manipulating Apple ][ language files and disk images.

Here is an example using the CLI to create a disk image that is then loaded into [microM8](https://paleotronic.com/software/microm8/) and booted.  This example assumes the working directory contains certain [file images](https://github.com/dfgordon/a2kit/wiki/LowLevel#file-images-and-the-any-type) and source code.  In practice one might choose to script such operations.
